# numixicons-Fixer
For Antergos, this shellscript changes to the correct icons some preinstalled applications.
* Only it works fine if Numix-Square is the selected icon theme.
* Tested for Antergos
* All programs preinstalled change their icon

To download and install easily, run:
```bash
wget https://github.com/Pronink/numixicons-Fixer/releases/download/v1/iconFixer.sh; sudo chmod +x iconFixer.sh; sudo ./iconFixer.sh
```
The script iconFixer.sh will be saved where you are when you ran the previous command.
You can run the script whenever you want to refresh new program icons.

Remember to be a privileged user ( or root ) to make the script work:
```bash
sudo ./iconFixer.sh
```
